                                A pixel, or Picture Element, is the fundamental unit of a digital image, much like a tiny
                                dot of paint on a canvas. Each pixel is a square of color that, when combined with others,
                                creates the full picture we see on screens. On monitors and televisions, pixels line up in
                                rows and columns to form the images you enjoy.
                            </p>

                                Transitioning from individual pixels to the vibrant displays before us, let's explore how
                                color is composed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Colors on a digital screen are composed using the RGB color model, which stands for Red,
                                Green, and Blue. By combining these three colors at various intensities, a wide spectrum of
                                colors can be created. For example, full intensity of all three gives white (R: 255, G: 255,
                                B: 255), while no intensity gives black (R: 0, G: 0, B: 0). This model is like mixing
                                paints, but with light! Each color component is typically represented by a value between 0
                                and 255, allowing for over 16 million possible colors in full RGB.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <!-- dropdown 3 -->
                    <li>
                        <button class="concept-toggler">
                            RGBA
                            <span class="material-symbols-rounded expand"> expand_circle_down </span>
                        </button>

                        <div class="concept-panel">
                            <p>
                                As an expansion to the RGB model, there's also an "alpha" component, often represented as
                                RGBA. Alpha indicates opacity and allows for the control over the transparency of a color.
                                With alpha, a value of 0% means completely transparent (invisible), while 100% is fully
                                opaque (solid color). This fourth value adds depth to graphics by allowing background images
                                to show through, creating layered visual effects.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>

                    <!-- dropdown 4 -->

                        <button class="concept-toggler">
                            What are HEX values?
                            <span class="material-symbols-rounded expand"> expand_circle_down </span>
                        </button>

                                Now, how do we specify these RGB colors in a way computers understand? Enter HEX values.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                Hex values come into play, as they are the language computers use to decipher color. A hex
                                value starts with a hashtag (#) and is followed by six or eight characters when including
                                alpha, which are numbers from 0 to 9 or letters from A to F; the first six characters are
                                actually two characters for each color component (Red, Green, and Blue), indicating how much
                                of each color is present, and the last two represent alpha. This hex code system is a bridge
                                between human color choices and precise digital display. For example, #FF0000 represents
                                full red (FF), no green (00), and no blue (00), resulting in a bright red color.
