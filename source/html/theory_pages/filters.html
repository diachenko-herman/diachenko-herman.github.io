                                As we already know, a digital image consists of many pixels. Now suppose you want to change this image to make it look blurrier,
                                sharper, or perhaps to highlight certain features. Convolutional matrices are tools used to achieve these effects. When you apply
                                a filter (like blur or sharpen), you're essentially applying a convolutional matrix to your image. The program does all the calculations
                                in the background, letting you see the effect almost instantly.

                                Think of a convolutional matrix as a small grid (usually 3x3 or 5x5). This grid has numbers in it, which determine how the
                                image will change. This grid is placed over the image, aligning with pixels at different positions as it moves across the 
                                entire image.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For each position of the grid on the image, a calculation is made. Each pixel under the grid is multiplied by the corresponding
                                number in the grid. All these products are added together to give a new value for the pixel in the center of the grid.
                                By changing the numbers in the grid, you can control how the image is altered. For example, a certain grid might make the image 
                                blurrier, another might enhance edges.

                                Blur: A simple blur effect can be achieved using a matrix where all numbers are equal, because each pixel becomes a mix of itself
                                and its neighbors.
                            </p>

                                Sharpen: A sharpening matrix often has a high number in the center and negative numbers around it. This setup increases the contrast
                                between neighboring pixels, making the image look clearer.

                                Edge Detection: These matrices are designed to highlight large differences in color, which correspond to edges within the image. They 
                                can make lines and boundaries more apparent.
